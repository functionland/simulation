# Classifying the Parameters

User level
- Cloud savings per month (could vary, also has intrinsic cost... not paying? they are using your data)
- Init. Hardware buyin (~35) (More than likely a constant)
- Base line cost ---> cloud subscription(s) totals

Simulation level

Variable:
- Miners 
- Time (months or years)
- Token Value
- Rate of token value increase (or decrease !)
- Power consumption (dependent on the config of the setup AND how many a person has)

Simulation level, but is dependent on other inputs
- Tokens acquired (monthly tokens / miners )
